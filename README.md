## About me
Hey, I'm [Daniel Wang](http://danielwang.github.io/bio), my personal ambition is to design and build world class Design Systems. I am interested in **Dark mode** (WCAG compliance),  **Theming** and **Motion designs**.

I am a time-poor person, who spent 2-3 hours each night from Mon to Thurdays. So I quickly wired things up by leveraging some frameworks and starter kits I am familiar with. It took me approximately 10 hours to get this far, like my daily work, 3/10 on designing, 5/10 on developing, 2/10 on documenting. If time allows, I'd like to explore and use Kaizen DS. 

I had a light touch on below areas, plesae let me know if you would like to explore more on any particular topics or skills missing from this list, e.g. CSS Module. I am more than happy to demostrate.
