I am a time-poor person, who spent 2-3 hours each night from Mon to Thurdays. So I quickly wire things up by leveraging some framework and starter kits I am familiar with. It took me approximately 10 hours to get this far, like my daily work, 3/10 on designing, 5/10 on develeping, 2/10 on documenting. If time allows, I would like to explore and use Kaizen DS. 

I had a light touch on below areas, plesae let me know if you would like to expore more on any particular topics or skills missing from this list. I am more than happy to demostrate, e.g. CSS Module.
